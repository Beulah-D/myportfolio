									<p>strategy and Operations Intern</p>
								</header>
								
									<p><ul>
										<li>Mapped end-to-end inpatient/outpatient workflows by creating high-level and detailed Swimlane process maps, shadowing 11
											patients, and analyzing procedure logs, wait times, and physician interviews; uncovered 5+ inefficiencies and implemented
											changes that reduced IR room turnover time by 25%.</li>
										<li>Designed and deployed Tableau dashboards to monitor 8+ KPIs—including idle time, procedural delays, and equipment use
											enabling real-time performance monitoring.</li>
										<li>Simulated radiology workflows using Arena and Process Analyzer, evaluating bed reallocation and tech-delay scenarios that
											increased IR room utilization by 20% (+11–20 patients/month) without structural expansion; model designed for replication
											across other DHS hospitals</li>
										<li>Developed a transferable operational framework and simulation model designed for scalability across the Department of Health Services (DHS) hospital network, supporting broader resource planning initiatives.

									<p><ul>
										<li>Collaborated with cross-functional teams to harmonize business requirements with user needs and conducted in-depth analysis
											using Python to identify user engagement and sentiment patterns, optimizing recommendation algorithms with Nvidia Merlin
											and Deep & Cross Network (DCN).</li>
										<li>Developed workflows to integrate and clean large datasets, conducting comprehensive data exploration and feature
											engineering in Python to identify key features like tracking time spent on page metrics to uncover trends that improved session
											duration which drove operational improvements used by around 120 users.</li>
										<li>Leveraged synthetic datasets and optimization techniques to elevate model accuracy to 0.9808 supporting engagement growth.</li>
